                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Silicon Shelf is a platform for tracking personal reading lists as well as coordinating reading with friends via reading clubs.</p>
                    <p>A single user can</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>add books to their own log</li>
                            <li>manage their reading list with status updates</li>
                            <li>track dates which they started and completed each book</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Users may also create and join reading clubs. This allows them to add a book to all their club members&apos; reading logs.</p>
                    <p>At this time, Administrative Management of the Database is under development, and user-intended functions are not yet implemented.</p>
