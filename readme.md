# OVERVIEW

Silicon Shelf is a platform for tracking personal reading lists as well as coordinating reading with friends via reading clubs. A single user can add books to their own log, manage their reading list with status updates, track dates which they started and completed each book. Users may create and join reading clubs. This allows them to add a book to all their club membersâ€™ reading logs. With an anticipated 10,000 monthly active users and an average yearly enqueue rate of 10 books per user, a robust relational database is needed.
